\begin{problem}
Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be a set of finitely many primes. Let $q$ be one more than the product of all elements of $S$. Consider that if $q$ is prime, then there must obviously be at least one prime number which is not enumerated in $S$. On the other hand, if $q$ is not prime, then by the fundamental theorem of algebra there must exist at least one prime factor of $q$, and this factor is not included in $S$ since $q$ is not divisible by any elements of $S$. Thus any finite enumeration of primes is necessarily incomplete.
\end{proof}
